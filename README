WELCOME TO WONDERGUI!
=====================

(I will write some nice introduction text here someday, I promise! ;)




Directory structure
===================

build/
        Project files and makefiles for various build environments. This is
        also where intermediate files and generated output is stored.
		
doc/
        Contains a Doxyfile for building the documentation with doxygen.
        Will be populated with generated API documentation when running 
        doxygen.
		
resources/
        Various files such as fonts and bitmaps used by the examples.
		
src/
        The source tree for WonderGUI, graphics devices, font libaries and examples.




Dependencies
============

The WonderGUI library does not have any dependencies beyond the standard
libraries supplied with any modern C++ compiler.

However, if you want to use vector fonts for text rendering (which you
likely do) you also need to build the font_freetype library, which adds a 
dependency on the FreeType2 development libary and headers.

The WonderGUI examples might have additional dependencies, most notably SDL2
(Simple DirectMedia Libary v2, www.libsdl.org) for handling user input and
displaying graphics on screen, as well as SDLImage2 for loading graphics files.
Some examples depend on font_freetype and thus also FreeType2.
 
The various GfxDevices naturally have dependencies on the graphics systems
they are created for (like OpenGL development files for glgfxdevice). Only the software-only device has no additional dependencies.



Happy Hacking, and let me know if you run into any problems!
