	 * @brief Provides access to items embedded into a Widget or Object.
	 *
	 * Interfaces are provided by Widgets and other reference counted Objects
	 * to provide API access to their embedded items such as labels and
	 * icons.
	 *
	 * The interface concept of WonderGUI serves two purposes:
	 *
	 * First it
	 * provides a nice API-level abstraction to keep methods for accessing
	 * different components of a widget logically separated while providing
	 * an identical way to access embedded items in all widgets that
	 * contains them.
	 *
	 * Secondly it provides a safe way to pass around pointers to the embedded
	 * items since interface pointers do reference counting on the object
	 * providing the interface, while pointing at the interface directly.
